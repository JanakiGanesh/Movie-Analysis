## Introduction

This project focus on analyzing certain factors such as Domestic Gross Value, Genres, Rating et for making a successful movie. It helps us in finding the type of movies that people like to watch and also to create a  high grossing movie. Microsoft team may use these analyses for their new beginning in the film industry. It would help them in creating a successful film.

## Business Problem

Microsoft seems all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. The project should focus on what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

These datasets were provided to me as a part of this project by the Flatiron School.

## Analysis

There are more Documentary movies with high ratings compared to other genres over the past years. This clearly shows that people like to watch Documentary movies.

The analysis shows that the maximum number of movies has an average runtime of around 90 minutes.

The movie with average runtime having high ratings.

 The movie with average runtime having the least customer ratings. Hence people have rated equally. This shows that the movie runtime has no impact on the viewers.

The analysis shows us that the movie released in the month of 'May' and 'June' has made high Domestic Revenue compared to other months.


## Recommendations
From the analysis of domestic revenue based on months, I would recommend releasing the movie in the month of May and June to become a successful one. It could be of many factors like the holiday season, weather, etc. It is best to make a film on average runtime as people have given an equal rating based on movie length. But still, we need to find if the people give a higher rating for high budget movies. Our future analysis could be on those criteria.







## Conclusion

Based on the rating, most of the movie categories have not changed over time. If our movie to be a successful one, choose 'Documentary' as it is highly popular among people. Most of the movies fall under the average runtime of 90 minutes but people have rated equally for any type of movie-length which helps us in finding the movie run time has no impact on the viewer’s point.
